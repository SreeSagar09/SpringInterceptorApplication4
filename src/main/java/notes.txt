A Program to demonstrate how to configure the multiple URLs to single interceptor:
Programs:
* AppConfig.java
* AppInit.java
* ActionHandlerController.java
* ActionHandlerInterceptor.java
Notes:
* To add url path patterns InterceptorRegistration class has provided two methods, those are:
* public InterceptorRegistration addPathPatterns(String... patterns), this method accept String var args.
* public InterceptorRegistration addPathPatterns(List<String> patterns), this method accept List of String.
* To exclude url path patterns also InterceptorRegistration class has provided two methods, those are:
* public InterceptorRegistration excludePathPatterns(String... patterns), this method accept String var args.
* public InterceptorRegistration excludePathPatterns(List<String> patterns), this method accept List of String.
Output:
